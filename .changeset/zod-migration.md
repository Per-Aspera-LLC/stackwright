Migrate grammar to Zod as single source of truth

Replace hand-written TypeScript interfaces and `typescript-json-schema` with Zod schemas across `@stackwright/types` and `@stackwright/themes`. TypeScript types are now inferred via `z.infer<>`. JSON schemas for IDE YAML validation are generated via `zod-to-json-schema` instead of `typescript-json-schema`. The CLI replaces AJV with Zod's `safeParse` for page and site validation. All Zod schemas are exported from their respective packages, enabling runtime grammar introspection for future MCP tooling and runtime validation.
